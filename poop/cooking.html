with microwaves:
<li>sweet potatos and japanese yams -- potato setting, or about 3-4 minutes, depending on size. should be easily poke-able with a fork</li>
<li>or a plain potato, I guess (suboptimal choice)</li>
<li>apples, pears, peaches -- about four minutes until squishy, like cooked pie fruit texture</li>
<li>not avocados</li>
<li>diced celery, frozen corn until cooked/heated, then add canned tuna, black pepper, salt, and kewpie mayo</li>
<li>chili or sesame oil-greased bowl (for ease of cleaning and flavor), egg with yolk popped/scrambled</li>
<li>+ water and stock powder/bouillon to make egg soup. wakame seaweed optional</li>
<br>
rice cooker cooking:
<br>
basic template: prepare rice as usual, with normal amount of water/liquid added. remove/add moisture depending on eyeballed wetness/dryness of added ingredients. stuff that needs to be cooked the most goes towards the bottom (i.e. potatoes, meat); stuff that are wiltable can go on the top, or stirred in after (i.e. spinach). do not crack in an egg in the beginning, it will cook before the rice is done and you will have non-soft rice. add halfway or so or just add the whole uncracked eggs in the beginning like me so you don't have to finagle with it until it's done. 
<br>
variations: 
<li>diced potatos, carrots, celery, and a block of japanese curry</li>
<li>odds-and-ends of cheap salmon, frozen mixed vegetables, white pepper, whole eggs to hard-boil</li>
<li>a costco chicken carcass, onions, carrots, cabbage, chicken bouillon granules, black pepper</li>
<li>a whole tomato (remmove a bit of cooking water), black pepper, salt, and olive oil</li>
<li>whatever goes with rice and you want to be heated through i.e. leftovers</li>
<br>
one-panners (a nice nonstick pan is ideal, alongside wooden chopsticks to keep it nice):
<br>
basic template: fry aromatics/what needs browning first, and/or the stuff that take the longest (i.e. raw meat, rice) + water. or you can wait until stuff is mostly cooked/dries out to make some space in the middle/to the side to fry an egg or aromatics. otherwise add water as needed until things are appropriate moist and cooked (risotto style). 
<li>mixed rice, risotto style (takes about 25 min start to finish)</li>
<li>mixed pasta, risotto style (takes about 15 min start to finish)</li>
<li>eggs, any which way</li>
<li>but especially tomato and egg, cantonese style</li>
<li>and bandook: like french toast, but with leftover curry mixed into the egg batter</li>
<li>tortilla with the egg cooked on top for little/no pan cleaning</li>
<br>
appliance free:
<li>peanut butter and cucumber sandwiches</li>
<li>or just peanut butter, with a spoon</li>
<li>cucmbers dipped with chili oil</li>
<li>romaine lettuce with peanut sauce</li>
