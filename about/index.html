Hi there! I'm a PhD student in computational systems biology who started in 2019. <br />

This is an alchemical endeavor to convert brain excretions to something pretty. <br />

Involves the attempted digestion of:

pathology, abnormalities, oddities, 

information theory, probability theory, cognitive biases, epistemology,

statistical and causal inference, data comprehension/visualization,

spectral graph theory, and complex systems (emergence, self organization, robustnesss), to name a few.

You can likely tempt me with mention of any of these subjects;
there isn't an order to that list except to attend to my primitive sense of humor.
