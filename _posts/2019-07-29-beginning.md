title: A beginning, of sorts
---

In less than a month, I'll become a matriculated PhD student -- I'm at the beginning of my PhD. 
But honestly, this feels like a formality.

I'm currently reading E.O. Wilson's __Consilience__ and he writes (p64):

> The creative process is an opaque mix. Perhaps only openly ocnfessional memoirs, still rare to nonexistent, might disclose >how scientists actually find their way to a publishable conclusion. In one sense scientific articles are deliberately >misleading. Just as a novel is better than the novelist, a scientific report is beter than the scientist, having been stripped >of all the confusions and ignoble thought that led to its composition. Yet such voluminous and incomprehensible chaff, soon to >be forgotten, contains most of the secrets of scientific success.

Presuming I achieve scientific success, I hope this blog might be able to capture some of that process. Partly inspired by the writings of bloggers like slatestarcodex and Andrew Gelman, I like the casual format of blogging, where the reasoning and grey areas of analyses can be more fully and frankly expressed. I dislike the tradition of presenting results in a way that suggests more premeditation/foresight than there actually was, especially when that portrayal made me think I'd be poor at research.

My years pre-PhD was me trying my hand at doing research 'my way', and seeing if it would lead to anything productive. I would summarize 'my way' as setting up a curiosity-driven (exploratory) system, and a large heft of optimism that the system will find itself somewhere productive. So far, it has some precedence, as it's responsible for my informal major in 'mindfulness', the discovery of my current fields of interest, and a conference paper published last year. 

I'm not sure if it's the best way, but Herbert Simon (a Nobelist quoted by E.O. Wilson just above the other quote) seems to validate me (p64):
> What chiefly characterizes creative thinking from more mundane forms are
> (i) willingnes to accept vaguely defined problem statements and gradually structure them,
> (ii) continuing preoccupation with problems over a considerable period of time, and
> (iii) extensive background knowledge in relevant and potentially relevant areas.

Years later I can reflect on my methodology and see how well it worked.
