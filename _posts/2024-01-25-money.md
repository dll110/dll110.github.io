I recently watched "Margin Call" with friends, and it's kind of like an action movie in that it's a good ride but you're not supposed to scrutinize the content too closely. I tried, and I was reminded of how I guess I've never quite internalized why people don't make the same financial decisions as me -- i.e. I would have 'fuck you' money so that I could quit if I were faced with such a moral dilemma (and this should be easy to save for given their incomes), and so the whole drama/tension that this film is largely based on would be escapable -- you win by being able to not play. But apparently it's not so simple.  

In response to my confusion, H recommended me 'The Psychology of Money' by Morgan Housler, who defines the psychology of money as the soft skill of how someone manages their finances. Sounds promising. It separates the ability to earn money and the ability to maintain money as separate skills, and mostly focuses on the latter.

The first chapter is about how people's experiences (culture, socioeconomics, economic current events) shape their psychology. 

I think the concept of tails were better explored and internalized in Antifragile. 


But then why do people with quite different background converge to a similar answer to how to manage their money? I'd say it's part 'childhood experience', but I think he does not explore the aspect of 'values' enough. Perhaps a more useful way to understand finance bros and my friends and I are that they value status more than freedom. At least through actions. 

This is stackranking again -- it's not like I think status doesn't matter nor would finance bros not value freedom. It's just that their spending habits optimize moreso for status than freedom. 

independent thinking and peer pressure.
salience of local vs global/big picture optimization
