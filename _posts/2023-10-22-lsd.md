For some reason, recreational drugs tend to not work as advertised on me. 

But I also am able to do things sober that people take drugs for, like stay up late, introspect, feel socially relaxed, etc. When I do take drugs, it's mostly for the curiosity for how it changes how you think; besides that I mostly find them uncomfortable. 

I wonder how much is physiological (like hardware, i.e. how many drug-relevant receptors I have) versus psychological (like software i.e. apparently non-stubborn people do better with dementia because they're more amenable to having their reality corrected).

Alcohol probably skews towards a hardware difference. Alcohol is skewed towards the side effects with little to no fun effects. I suspect I have efficient alcohol to aldehyde (causes the unwanted side effects) conversion, and slow aldehyde to acetic acid (non-toxic end product) conversion; I can get a headache from a shot of beer and can really only get tipsy (which mostly feels like being tired) with liquor/high alcohol percentage. I might as well get sleepy and loopy withh no side effects.

Caffeine I'm not as sure of -- it does not seem to help me concentrate/focus better. I drink it for the taste: I like that it's hot, a strong bitter flavor that is nice to sip slowly as I do work (sweet drinks I tend to down; cold liquids make me distractingly cold and uncomfortable, and hot water is boring). Drinking too much caffeine can make me jittery and unable to sleep though, so it's similar to alcohol in that its neegative side effects are more salient to me, with little to no observed positive effects.

LSD is commonly advertised to be life-changing, inspirational, etc. As someone generally interested in perspective shifts, I was intrigued.

I ended taking twice the standard dose because it did not seem to be doing much with one. I thought the visual hallucinations/patterns were boring; it's like watching one of those 90's screensavers. 


I suspect that LSD is associated with insight because it lowers your resolution of thought. And so instead getting caught up with the details, you round it, and 

I can see why it's something to do with friends because you can be more suggestible --
