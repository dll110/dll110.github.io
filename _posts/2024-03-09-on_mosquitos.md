- stay covered up; wear long sleeves and long pants
- avoid hanging out too much at night
- particularly near sketchy forests
- bring spray for protection
- hang out with other attractive people
- commiserate with them
- complain about the twenty solicitations from a single night while your friends have none
- sulk about it for weeks
- borrow your friend's expensive lotion to mitigate the itching
- be glad that malaria is not endemic to your region
