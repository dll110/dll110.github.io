In the days I was young, when I was working in the biology of aging and before mech interp became a salient topic, I came across ["Growing Neural Automata"]()
So arguably, the first time I did mech interp was in 2021, when it was not yet cool. 

I found it compelling because I was working on methylation clocks, and epigenetics seems to correspond heavily to cell phenotype, so I was wondering why 
do they respond to each other differently? learning the rules of 

somehow, the visualization of training the cell to learn rules and 

I wanted to know what changed in the rules to make the image more robust.

so I ran PCA on the channels and colored the top PCS.

I think the result reminds me of embryology, where establishing polarity (i.e. dorsal/ventral) is a fundamental step; it establishes a relative map for cells to know where they should be.   

I had been reading Waddington, who frames aging as extended development.

dead systems when looking at values?

I guess the common trend is losing interest when I realize that the system is lacking characteristics of the type of system I find interesting -- here, the individual cells aren't 'selfish', so there isn't the tension of local versus global optimization. I guess this might be a good metaphor for pediatric cancers, but less so of adult cancers.
