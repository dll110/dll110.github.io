I’ve been intending to start a public blog since the beginning of this year, nearly 8 months now. 

I’m hoping that this will help me:

better find and engage with people with similar interests by laying them out somewhere
and by extension, build a practical platform to get feedback on my thoughts
process ideas that are stewing around through writing itself
The main obstacles I’ve encountered are:

finding a platform that suits my usage: 
I want it to be professional-ish (less embarrassment in linking to for a CV, but might just aim for social contexts)
while I like the ease of formatting tumblr has, it’s not formal enough
currently going with github pages, but there’s a learning curve I’m still at the bottom of
comment-able, to be able to better engage with online communities
writing/content 
trying to iron out my thoughts on technical subjects through writing doesn’t come easily; most of my casual writing is to iron out personal problems weighing on my mind
relatedly, I’m used to only writing a paragraph or two at a time, but a more professional blog seems like it should be longer and more polished
I’m procrastinating. I think I should lower my standards and just start. 

Simple is fine, informal is fine, even wrong is fine (just correct things when that’s realized), but just start.
