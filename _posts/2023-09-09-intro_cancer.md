A friend recently reached out to ask my thoughts on cancer treatments for a terminally ill family member 'because I know biology'. And I realized that despite all my years in biomedical research, I had very little to say; I know surprisingly little about cancer. I guess it's kind of like asking a software engineer why your computer doesn't work. 

Nonetheless, it's an interesting gap in knowledge, and unsurprising: Off the top of my head, I've only read two books about cancer: "Emperor of All Maladies" and "The Selfish Cell".  Let's how much we can try to fill in.

Initial gaps in my understanding that seem interesting:
1. pediatric vs adult cancer -- are there trends in how they arise?
2. immuno-oncology: how much of cancer incidences involve oversight/dysregulation of the immune system? 
3. how do various cancer treatments purportedly work?
4. are there underlying principles regarding the types of cancers that tend to arise from the different tissue/organ systems?
5. why do larger animals not have a higher rate of cancer?
6. what can cancer tell you about multicellular self-organization?

I anticipate these being rabbit-holes that don't have obvious endpoints, so I'll artificially constrain it to 'how much I can find out in an arbitrary week'. 

Some basics of cancer that I found interesting:

[a decent overview]()
density dependent inhibition
autocrine growth stimulation
contact inhibition via cell-cell or cell-matrix contact
defective differentiation


1. pediatric vs adult cancer -- are there trends in how they arise?

"Pediatric cancer is a developmental disease" -- in _Origins of Order_, Kauffman suggests considering cancer as a 'disease of differentiation', but when I asked a professor who had thought a lot about the evolution of cancer for her research, she said that the current thought is that cancer is moreso a de novo adaptation than an aatavism towards a more stem-like cell type. But perhaps Kauffman's suggestion may be more true for pediatric cancers (new question: what can they tell us about the origins of new cell types?). Because they are moreso caused by 'disorganization' than adapatation, they have lower mutational burden, though with broader epigenetic dysregulation (and epigenetics are where cell types are distinguished). (Some intriguing bio tidbits I've filed away are the observations that there are some cancers that seem to be [fully epigenetic]() and that it seems possible to take a (specific) cancer and have it functionally integrate with embryonic cells to become a viable organism.) This may be associated with the greater incidence of fusion genes, but I don't really have any idea of how fusion genes work right now and why it'd relate to cancer (second new question: are there principles underlying how and which genes can recombine?). The most common pediatric cancers are leukemia, central nervous system tumors, neuroblastomas, and teratomas; an underlying trend is that pediatric cancers tend to have a nonepithelial origin, originating from stem or progenitor cells during a particular time window (third question: what makes them diverge in the first place? how does the time window affect their phenotype/prognosis?). 


On the other hand, adult cancers are generally of epithelial origin (carcinomas apparently account for 90% of cancers). This seems to be related to the higher turnover in these tissues, as they tend to interface with the environment. The most common adult cancers are in the lung, prostate, breast, colon, and pancreas, and sensibly, lung and colon cancers are associated with environmental stressors -- most lung cancer cases are related to smoking, and most colon cancer cases are preceded by inflammatory gut problems. I am not sure why skin cancers aren't as high up. Instead we have prostate and breast cancer, which can be categorized as the hormonally-driven cancers. And pancreatic cancer, which is just so insidious that despite relatively low incidence, its high mortality puts it up there.



There are different treatment/intervention considerations for pediatric versus adult cancers, particularly given their different etiologies. For neuroblastomas in particular, it is expected that some will [spontaneously regress](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5920563/), and no intervention is needed ('Did I really have cancer when I was a baby mum?', 'Yes don't worry, you grew out of it honey.'). And because pediatric cancers tend to arise an earlier developmental time window (as early as !), these cancer cells tend to retain fetus-specific antigens that are (relatively) absent from postnatal tissues, so you can easily target them. 
Pediatric cancers tend to have lower recurrence but have a higher concern for long-term side effects, mostly because they're still developing, but also that their cancers tend to be treated more aggressively (fourth question: why?).

2. immuno-oncology: how much of cancer incidences involve oversight/dysregulation of the immune system? and other higher-level regulatory mechanisms (i.e. metabolism?)

3. how do various cancer treatments purportedly work?

The main treatment approaches to cancer seem to be: surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation. Actual treatments seems to often be some combination of them. Somehow, surgery and radiation seems sufficiently self-explanatory so I'll focus on how various chemotherapies work. 


novel approaches
I guess immunotherapy isn't established enough to make it to standard practice considerations. But I think it is most intriguing. 

Yet for all the local inflammation in tumours, in many cases the overall innate immunity of the host is blunted.

signalling confusion -- can there be a cytokine/signaling reset like in atrial fibrillation

acute infection

4. are there underlying principles regarding the types of cancers that tend to arise from the different tissue/organ systems?

carcinomas/epithelial; envrionmental insults and turnover 
why not skin? but colonic (inflamamtion?)
tumors as wounds that never heal
inflammation as preventing apoptosis, facilitating accumulation of dna damage?

chronic inflammation causes oxidative stress and dna damage

https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10038208/ metabolic reprogramming in sepsis
immune paralysis: hyperinflammation and immunosuppression
hyperinflammation; oxphos -> aerobic glycolysis -> lactic acid -> immunosuppression (fao)
"Therefore, limiting the glycolysis pathway can reduce organ damage caused by an “inflammation storm” in the early stage of sepsis."
gpr65 and glycolysis?
in dss, prevents inflammatory response if the gpr65 kos don't reprogram to glycolysis
higher inflammatory markers in gpr65 ko at baseline; low ph detection inhibits cytokine release; higher functional innate immunity? or lower/weaker inflammatory cascade?

"Therefore, the essence of inflammation-targeting cancer therapy is how to accurately identify the type of inflammation and selectively promote cancer-inhibiting inflammation and inhibit cancer-promoting inflammation."


lowered ecm/cell interactions? 
causes increased mutation? or epigenetic

lung (smoking, 85 of cases)

breast/prostate (hormonal? why?)
hormones control rate of cell division
but why is this such a relatively fragile process? 
what about other controls of growth, i.e. hgh, diabetes/obesity/metabolic disorders

diabetes yes

obesity due to inflammation



deadliest cancers/lowest survival rate

pancreatic cancer, exocrine (make digestive enzymes) -- hard to detect early, don't respond as well to commonly used therapies, why?
brain (presuming hard to treat bc of location)
small cell lung cancer
mesotheliomas, 
gallbladder
esophageal


by organ, vs by subtype
i.e. cell type of origin


5. why do larger animals not have a higher rate of cancer?

I've actually come across an answer to this before, but I apparently didn't learn it well because the vague answer in my head doesn't feel fully coherent. It might've been something related to cancer having difficulty taking over the greater mass of a larger organism.(ah, my memory is excellent, it was from an episode of [SciShow](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1HFP84RXak&ab_channel=SciShow), and the concept I'm thinking of is hypertumors --  it seems like it's a controversial hypothesis though.)

This question seems encompassed by [Peto's Paradox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peto%27s_paradox), on the observation that the incidence of cancer between species doesn't correspond to their number of cells or lifespan.


lower metabolic rate
evolutionary tradeoff (fertility )
various mechanisms

whales, elephants

In one experiment, laboratory mice were genetically altered to express "always-on" (always on meaning it doesn't get deactivated by the MDM2 gene) active TP53 tumor antigens,[clarification needed] similar to the ones found in elephants. The mutated mice exhibited increased tumor suppression ability, but also showed signs of premature aging.[22]
Another study placed p53 under normal regulatory control and did not find signs of premature aging. It is assumed that under its native promoter p53 does not cause premature aging, unlike constitutively expressed p53.[23]

why premature aging?

tumor suppressing and premature aging
anti aging to decrease risk of cancer

6. what can cancer tell you about multicellular self-organization?
