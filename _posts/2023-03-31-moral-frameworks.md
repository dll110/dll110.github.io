revisiting moral frameworks, explicitly
the case for confronting the taboos 

why my morals are the way they are
or, why my morals are the way they are

Sometimes I realize that I have nice things without really knowing how I got them, so I then feel compelled to try to figure out how I managed it, in order to be able to give myself advice in case I ever lost them.  

I think the first time I thought along these lines was wondering why I have good friends back in college. But currently I want to dissect why my morals are the way they are. Partly because they make so much sense to me that I’m not sure why there aren’t more people with ths framework. So let me try to lay it out legibly, so that divergences could be pointed out explicitly. [recent events with david]


It all started with the question, ironically, of why people believe different things than me. I was in high school, having become fascinated with the explanatory power of evolutionary theory, and inevitably stumbled across Creationism. In the pursuit of understanding religion, 


on free will: the difficulty of choosing your compulsions
christian deconversion, not being able to choose what is compelling
ocd, serial killers, queerness

I think this is underpinned by the belief that I would not act any differently from others if I were in their shoes – they make sense given their circumstances. Including pedophiles, serial killers, mass murderers, etc. And following the rule of ‘treat others as you want to be treated’, I would want others to be patient and compassionate with me if I am striving to understand and change myself. This is the kind of society I’d want to live in, one that is not ruthless, but gives space to make and learn from mistakes, ideally at root cause if possible, and not merely providing punishment at the level of symptoms. 


on understanding: more satisfying than judging

I did not know how to convince myself to believe in God, but I was envious of their heuristic of having a north star, an efficient global way to evaluate what the right thing is. And so I wanted one of my own. I tried ‘understanding’, and have not been compelled to change it since. 

In high school, when I realized that I did not find the Christian God compelling, but felt compelled to put something on a pedestal, to be sacred above all else, I tried ‘understanding’. 
i want my friends to be able to speak plainly to me. To do so, there must be low consequence for explanation.  

I had a phase of watching documentaries at the time, and I came across Louis Theroux. I liked his approach to 

In a book (perhaps “The Righteous Mind”?) I read a while back, I came across this quote by Baruch Spinoza: “I have striven not to laugh at human actions, not to weep at them, nor to hate them, but to understand them.” I think this comprises much of my framework. 

on getting good quality information:

So the question becomes, how do you come to understand them? Especially considering that I have trouble with subtelty, of reading between the lines. 

I was aware that religion is a sensitive topic, but I wanted to know 

Otherwise, I think this is the better attitude to adopt, especially for my value of getting the least filtered version of people. My thinking is that people are least likely to filter if there’s low judgment for it, and this is the way I can adopt an attitude of least judgment.

Because you can tell someone that they can talk to you about anything, but your actions can impede that offer. I am not warm, people don’t often come to me with personal problems.



What it means to have a nice framework:

I realize that it might not be agreed upon that this framework is something ‘nice’. Because my conclusion with this framework is that it’s okay to be friends with a pedophile. So I guess I should caveat that it is satisfying for a certain aesthetic. 

“Finding your voice means figuring out what you wouldn’t mind being disliked for. You have to find some way of being where, if someone came up to you and said, “I don’t like the way you are,” you would say, “That’s all right, I still think this is the right way to be."

 I’m not inclined to judge people for where they are at, but rather how they try to go from here. You have no control over where you are, you can only try to control where you go from there. I admire the character who can look at reality, at what things are, unflinchingly, clearly. I think that is the best way to then decide a path forward, and improve things. CP is an especially hard incompetency to accept, but I admire a character who strives to accept it, examine it, and think about where to go from there. 


I think I have this confidence because the point of all this was so that people who I care about would have someone that they could rely on to  ideally be comfortable talking to me about anything, especially when things are hard. And to at least some degree, it worked. 

Friends talk to me about sensitive topics. People tell me what it’s like to be in their heads, almost uncensored. (David, Tim, Shaila)



, Christianity, serial killers – we don't choose what we believe/are compelled by

having OCD, feeling relatively benign compulsions 

So When Timar told me to not be friends with David, I think I felt a mild indignance.

I’ve thought this out quite deeply already. In fact, I've been prepared for a situation like this since college – what to do if my friends did something criminal/immoral?

perhaps it’s misguided sympathy

oh what a surprise
how to help solve problems, part framing, looking at what is, vs expecting each to conform polite society, a buffer that is useful but also obscures

prevention

She said people have to confront the physical reality of gun violence without the polite filters. “The country won’t be ready for it, but that’s what needs to happen. That’s the only chance at all for this to ever be reversed.”

“Diana, don’t tell this to others, it could ruin you professionally,” warn my close friends. But it just feels like the right thing to do, to me. I feel assured in my framework. 

But this is just for as much as you can tolerate it – I’m not interested enough in dangerous serial killers, homeless (not coherent), and I’m very stressed by downward spirals, i.e. Bojack Horseman, Requiem for a Dream. I’ve also found intolerable idiosyncratic things like speaking too slowly.

Otherwise, I think this is the better attitude to adopt, especially for my value of getting the least filtered version of people. My thinking is that people are least likely to filter if there’s low judgment for it, and this is the way I can adopt an attitude of least judgment.

Timar brought up the good question of what is sufficient moral competence for friendship. And I think besides frictions around safety, integrity, and efficiency (slow talking), I’m not inclined to judge people for where they are at, but rather how they try to go from here. You have no control over where you are, you can only try to control where you go from there. I admire the character who can look at reality, at what things are, unflinchingly, clearly. I think that is the best way to then decide a path forward, and improve things. CP is an especially hard incompetency to accept, but I admire a character who strives to accept it, examine it, and think about where to go from there. 

Why do I have greater tolerance for moral incompetence? It’s hard to understand how your brain works; I wouldn’t know how to get out of it either if I were in their shoes. Meanwhile, I have low tolerance for people being slow and inefficient, maybe because it feels much more learnable/improvable.
Where does my tolerance end? I’m reminded of Muhammed, an acquaintance of Isabel’s; I disliked him quickly when his comments suggested that his ego was more important than physically hurting someone else.
