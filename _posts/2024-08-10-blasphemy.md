Because my god demands priority, I inevitably take actions that offend ~lesser~ other gods. Here are some of the ways:

- jaywalking
- wearing socks with sandals
- microwaving water (for tea)
- drinking instant decaf coffee
- cooking italian pasta risotto style
- 2x speeding tedtalks
- 2x speeding movies
- reading the wikipedia for a movie instead of watching it
- reading the wikipedia for a movie while watching it
