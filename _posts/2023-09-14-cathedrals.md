A friend once introduced me as someone who 'is unusually poor at modeling other people but understands herself unusually well'. So I suspect that this will not be broadly applicable, but if it helps even one, it will be a success.

It has yet again come to my attention that many of my peers are still fixated on relative intelligence -- maybe this includes you. It is understandable; intelligence is significant currency in these social circles. 

But I’m of the thought that intelligence is kind of like happiness and current events, in that, despite the hubbub, nothing bad happens if you stop actively thinking about it. In fact, not thinking about it generally makes life better, maybe because there is little to no effective control knobs at this level.  

Because, what is 'intelligence' anyway? 

‘Intelligence’ is one of the nebulous words that is full of conflation, and there is at least two connotations worth distinguishing for our purpose: 
1) giftedness, quick-witted, witty; an innate trait

2) studious, disciplined, well-read; a learned trait

What if you are neither of these things? What if you are average, a mean or median, who cares – maybe below average, lazy, curiously bereft of common sense, undistinguished, a platonic ideal of an idiot, etc? Poor, poor you, what are you goinng to do?

Some seem to wallow, resigned to an uninspired life -- this is unexciting. 
Others try to fake it, and invest their efforts into signaling intelligence without substance to back it. Besides sounding stressful, this is just ugly.

I say: Build a cathedral.

A cathedral, as in an awe-inspiring structure, built of from a marriage of spiritual ideals and inspired engineering, a concrete implementation of abstract ideals, of fractalish details, a curation of art and design. 

A cathedral, as in a kludgey assemblage of abstractions, frameworks and heuristics to navigate the world, containing after-thought extensions, winding pathways, and unexpected backdoors.  

But, a cathedral that is your own, and you are its chief architect.

I only stumbled across it accidentally, and was indignant that adults didn't tell me about it and I almost missed it. But now, as an experienced adtult, it seems that most adults don't know about it.

I think it is alluded to. This is what independent thinking is, as I understand it.

But I do not think it is discussed enough as a thing you can do. Or, I've yet to see it discussed explicitly. Perhaps it's like a cliche, where you it makes sense when you first encounter it, but you don't quite realize how superficial your interpretation is until you obtain the right perspective, and then you _understand_. 

For me, it began with “The Selfish Gene”. Something shifted when I realized it’s not just about accurately embedding information in your head – there is such thing as better arrangements of information. This was the start of a concept I call ‘mental interior design’, what I use to reference how you can curate and organize how you think about things; reading is an excellent way to go ‘shopping’ for improved tools and objects. It took years to be able to first try and put this shift into words: I first settled on 'thinking about thinking'. 

But this is not enough to have a cathedral. 

Maybe it's when you hit a critical point, that no one talks about, where backdoors and shorcuts between ideas between different domains begin to form. And then you begin to see coherence, and you begin to hope for a theory of everything. Or maybe it's when you realize that science is not so different from art, that 'all models are imperfect, but some are useful' (or beautiful). 


It will take time; I do not know of a shortcut. 

But it is a possible path, it is beautiful, and I recommend it highly.
