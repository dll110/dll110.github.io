tentative summary of book: 'work (thermodynamic to morphodynamic to teleodynamic) to create constraint to keep dynamics far from equilibrium/naive expectation, exploring edges of possibility space'

synthesizing threads from hofstadter, kauffman, shannon, constraint (pattee); to a lesser extent, rosen

‘My counterintuitive hypothesis is that whenever we recognize that a system exhibits intentional properties, it is not because of something addd to the physical process involved, but rather quite literally because it depends on the physical fact of something specifically missing from that object or process (43)
=> Pattee? pruning of neurons?


stuart kauffman: ‘it takes constraints on the release of energy to perform work, but it takes work to create constraints’
‘constraints are information and information is constraint (392)

‘Being alive does not merely consist in being composed in a partiular way. It consists of changing in a particular way’ (175)
maybe why i loved calculus

‘there are no components to what is absent (204)

# information and meaning

i.e. typo in a manuscript, indicative of reference info from langue or info about proficiency of typist
reflection of work imposed on it; source of work varies by context (391)

improbability of being far from equilibrium ~= potential to do work; measure of work performed on it
=> ‘a stable system is a dead system’

[shannon information[referential information[significant information]]]

no alternatives = no uncertainty = no information (380)
shannon entropy: probability of receiving a given signal from among those possible; boltzmann entropy: probability a given signal has been corrupted
signal repertoire -> signal -> channel -> received message
work to decrease shannon entropy of signal with redundancy, increased boltzman entropy due to noise in the channel
entropy of message (original) -> telecommunications (decreased entropy via redundancy for noise channel, which will increase entropy) -> entropy of received entropy is ideally equal to original (388)
informative power of absence (i.e. no news being indicative)
shannon information != referential information
constraint is not in the signal medium, but relationship between what is and what could have been; meta?
=> in the mapping function?



# metabolism-first biology
lorenzo's paper

morphology reproducers (microtubules, prions) -> energy cycling (ATP) -> information replication (DNA, virus) (452)
=> if prions and viruses encapsulate on components of life, are there ones that encapsulate only partially that includes energy cycling?
life: about metabolism/constraint on energy cycling?
=> senescent cells/cells in multicellular organisms with degraded DNA? dead end parasite

DNA as an adaptation for stability (436)
machinery/metabolism
prions as replication ‘dead ends’ (439)
value is partly in its interdependence with other molecules, not information is own/wrong context
=> junk DNA: has anyone tried cutting them all out and seeing if everything still works?‘replicator, but does not replicate itself, but through cell 

arc's evo foundational model:
a process that regularly transforms incidental physical properties into functional attributes
foundational model on the genome – overlooks the physical properties aspect
insilico vs biological evolution: insilico is information only (280)
also energetic-material-formative
i.e. hemoglobin (iron) -> red -> information for parasites
=> like natural selection (genetics) + self organization



“Evolution is not imposed design, but progressive constraint” (426)



#introspecting/building cathedrals/intra-operation

to understand what something, what it is not (191)
=> i.e. in understanding yourself


brains: ‘not arbitrary, general-purpose, informaction-processing devices’, ‘evolved to support whole-organism functions for persistence and reproduction’ (474)
=> not sure why I lack a fear of death, seems like self-preservation should be the default

stuart kauffman: ‘it takes constraints on the release of energy to perform work, but it takes work to create constraints’
‘constraints are information and information is constraint (392)
=> random? thought: LSD + having space to direct attention before intuition kicks in - for better or worse
-> what is this mechanism?


mental information is not in individual normal firing patterns, but attractor dynamics (516)
wrong level of scale and physical manifestation
on the mapping from the material to immaterial (pattern/dynamics)
fmri [pic of my own brain?]

‘generating more precise mental content takes both more ‘effort’ and a more sustained ‘focus’ of attention’
=> ironic because I feel mentally lazy, but care about nuance


#AGI
critical thinking to create constraints, AGI
sentience (vs mere computation): the self-creation of constraints’
=> what LLMs need to move onto AGI?

for highly automatic skill there is almost no metabolic differential’ early stages of learning are very demanding of constant attention to sensory and motor details (537)
=> the average adult is bad at learning because they have a lot of mental clutter that provides less resources/energy to learn something new, and learning requires a minimum threshold investment of energy?
=> physical learning systems, andrea liu
