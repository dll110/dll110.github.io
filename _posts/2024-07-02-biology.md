_or, a synthesis of my stint in biology_


#incomplete nature

tentative summary of book: 'work (thermodynamic to morphodynamic to teleodynamic) to create constraint to keep dynamics far from equilibrium/naive expectation, exploring edges of possibility space'

This book conveniently synthesizes complex systems adjacent concepts that I like and have been collecting over the years, e.g. hofstadter, kauffman, shannon, constraint (pattee); to a lesser extent, rosen

I would've enjoyed reading this several years ago, when I first came across Howard Pattee's claim: “the way to get novelty is not to create something new but to constrain what was there before" because I found it baffling and counterintuitive -- but I think I've slowly understood it better over the years. Meanwhile, this book is surprisingly centered around 'constraint' -- there is a whole chapter devoted to it. He's even got Stuart Kauffman on board: ‘it takes constraints on the release of energy to perform work, but it takes work to create constraints’
‘constraints are information and information is constraint' (392)

“Evolution is not imposed design, but progressive constraint” (426)

‘My counterintuitive hypothesis is that whenever we recognize that a system exhibits intentional properties, it is not because of something addd to the physical process involved, but rather quite literally because it depends on the physical fact of something specifically missing from that object or process (43)
=> Pattee? pruning of neurons?

‘Being alive does not merely consist in being composed in a partiular way. It consists of changing in a particular way’ (175)
maybe why i loved calculus


#aging

## senescence

## growing neural automata

## metabolism first

## what you see is what persists -- life

## structuralism vs adaptationalism
