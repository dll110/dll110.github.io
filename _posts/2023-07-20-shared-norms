title: “This is water”
goal: to elucide/make legible a lot of my cultural norms
a derivation of The shared version of the six norms

I used to be envious of people who were best friends, and now I am lucky to find myself a third of a complementary trio of close friends. It’s been interesting to try to analyze our unspoken norms, our deep assumptions on how you're supposed to interact with others. Here is a guide to integrate into our coveted crew. 

We have a more distant starting point relative to other people. Like we are all foreigners from different countries in one room together, slowly processing language and thinking slowly through all the lossy communications.

The identified norms:
1. commitment
	Communication is expensive bc of the distance; decisions are expensive due to slow processing. Therefore make fewer, deliberate, more well-considered decisions.
Model yourself with global coherency and present yourself to other people with as much consistency as possible.
Since decisions are assumed to have the full trajectory in mind, the decision maker is always responsible for the outcome. No resentment allowed.

The NT experience: communication is cheaper and decisions are made more impulsively and with more indirect influence between people. 

2. intention orientation
 we read only intention, and expression/reception of (negative) emotion are negotiated explicitly. hard to control emotion

 The NT experience: emotional expressions are not lossy. So you’re responsible for expressing just the right emotion and ensuring it will be received right. You get brownie points for expressing/receiving emotion more explicitly, but it’s not required -- if you receive an emotion a particular way, you just move forward assuming you received it correctly.


3. separation of personal and factual
Taste and logic are extremely distinct, and they both always matter. 
It’s assumed that all logic is motivated by emotion. There are no objective value judgments. Conversely, there’s always a logic to emotion.
Everything outside of the driving emotional core can be challenged, including beliefs about the emotional core. But the fact that there is a core is a given, and it can never be wrong, because feelings are just feelings.
We try very hard to distinguish statements of facts and statements of feeling.
The NT experience: everything is strongly interconnected with self concept. Any statement about somebody is assumed to impact their self concept and should be spoken/understood with that assumption as a given. E.g., “I don’t like your shirt” is similar to “You look ugly in that shirt.”


4. good faith
Everybody has coherent models and is trying to communicate clearly about them, so if you disagree, assume that they have something else coherent in view. The conversation is about clarifying all the facts so that the contract can be negotiated trivially afterwards and address the emotional needs exactly right. 
It’s assumed that mutual understanding is a long, slow process. It is most of the process of conversation.
At the object level, everything can be questioned, including somebody’s logic and standing. At the meta level, we always trust each other to be able to align, and that’s why we’re here; it’s never in question as long as we’re present.
What do we do when we think we understand the other and believe they’re just wrong? What if both people think that?
The person who believes they understand has the burden of proof. They need to convince the other that they understand. This right to request convincing can be waived.


5. moral truth seeking vs self-interested purity
No responsibility to always look for the truth generally, because there’s so much of it, and also truth is instrumental so you should do what’s interesting to you. High interest to purify what you do model.
Always interested in improving our understanding of things we already care about. No moral responsibility to purify what you model; it’s just assumed to be of interest. 
Permitted to not care about lots of things; permitted to put model-flaws on the backburner.
The rationalist experience: Moral responsibility to seeking the truth immediately.


6. separation of personal and societal
We see society as pretty arbitrary, so we prefer to locate everything relative to ourselves as individuals.
We care about sociology because it’s interesting or useful. But we’re not attached.
We judge things freely, but only as far as they relate to our interests. Bc we don’t evaluate people’s worth in a broader societal-values sense, we come off nonjudgmental.
In practice, we accept all but also find people uninteresting or aesthetically displeasing -- people tend to feel accepted if they don’t end up discovering the second half.
The NT experience: Everything can tie quite strongly to your societal worth. 



Are there deeper trends behind these observations? Let’s try.

I think a number of these norms can be explained by the intention to be as accepting and understanding of the other as possible -- especially in the context of not having a strong prior on how the other is. 
This means starting from a relatively naive stance. And then where to go from there? 

They should have the best access to their internal state, so it involves giving high/default trust in their explanations of their internal state, most especially on root feelings (3,4). This relates to a wider acceptance of decisions made (1), even if unorthodox, because we assume they understand their own value system better. But then it’s also assumed that you’d take responsibility for the consequences, because you also have the most control for future situations. In conceptualizing feelings as data and not something under the person’s control, we also put more weight into intention than emotional flyaways. 

personal congruence 

focus on what you can control
responsibility for decisions
focus on content bc you cannot control emotional reactions, although maybe indirectly through attitude/perspective changes – takes longer/less reliable though
taking things literally
nuance enabled you to de conflating and give you enough degrees of freedom to resolve a seeming paradox

things are more effortful, slower feedback about feelings





Tentative framing of norms: 
We have a more distant starting point relative to other people. Like we are all foreigners from different countries in one room together, slowly processing language and thinking slowly through all the lossy communications.
D is more distant in that she has no intuition, so we have to rationalize all our explanations against her. Bc she’s further from the culture, she asks the good questions, and we have to pass the test of convincing her.
We are all closer to each other than other people, but still distant.
Our similarity is our distance and strategy of building epistemologically self-aware models with as much purity as possible. 
We were like this independently, rather than building these values together.
The built culture is more about translating words for each other. 

Differences in norms
“Commitment”: after deliberate, global consideration
Communication is expensive bc of the distance; decisions are expensive due to slow processing. Therefore make fewer, deliberate, more well-considered decisions.
Model yourself with global coherency and present yourself to other people with as much consistency as possible.
Since decisions are assumed to have the full trajectory in mind, the decision maker is always responsible for the outcome. No resentment allowed.
Example: Brian didn’t find it that interesting to watch D or O play a solo game, but even though this was disappointing for O to learn (after many hours of doing this), O respects the choice; B chose it bc he wanted to do it, out of the options present.
Example: D accompanying S on things.
The NT experience: communication is cheaper and decisions are made more impulsively and with more indirect influence between people. There is shared responsibility in terms of influencing others and making decisions yourself. Plans are more robust because people are flexible, process quickly on their own, and communicate quickly with others. It’s ok to be messy and say that you’re good with a particular choice and then later resent it.
“Intention orientation”: we read only intention, and expression/reception of (negative) emotion are negotiated explicitly.
Things are very harmonious, despite how abrasive Brian might seem.
Assumed that emotionally negative expressions are very lossy. So if something comes off harsh, we assume it wasn’t meant that way and ask for adjustment. If we feel negatively or detect negative emotion, we check it explicitly and then put everything on the table explicitly. 
After understanding each other’s state, moving forward on any plan requires mutual agreement. Space is always respected.
B and O being angry is a good example: we express things angrily at each other, but only put weight on the things that we explicitly express weightily.
The NT experience: emotional expressions are not lossy. So you’re responsible for expressing just the right emotion and ensuring it will be received right. You get brownie points for expressing/receiving emotion more explicitly, but it’s not required -- if you receive an emotion a particular way, you just move forward assuming you received it correctly.
“Separation of personal and factual”: Taste and logic are extremely distinct, and they both always matter. 
It’s assumed that all logic is motivated by emotion. There are no objective value judgments. Conversely, there’s always a logic to emotion.
Everything outside of the driving emotional core can be challenged, including beliefs about the emotional core. But the fact that there is a core is a given, and it can never be wrong, because feelings are just feelings.
We try very hard to distinguish statements of facts and statements of feeling.
Statements of fact can be precise right up to the line of personal. That doesn’t need additional context.
It doesn’t work from the other direction, because of #4 (“Good Faith”). The assumption is that conversation is for resolving misunderstanding. Expressing feelings without context is confusing/ambiguous/threatening because it feels like it’s going towards another direction besides factual illumination.
The NT experience: everything is strongly interconnected with self concept. Any statement about somebody is assumed to impact their self concept and should be spoken/understood with that assumption as a given. E.g., “I don’t like your shirt” is similar to “You look ugly in that shirt.”
Caveat: we can understand when NTs intend to offend somebody else, and it lands that way for us. But we prefer to maintain clear separation.
“Good Faith”: Everybody has coherent models and is trying to communicate clearly about them, so if you disagree, assume that they have something else coherent in view. The conversation is about clarifying all the facts so that the contract can be negotiated trivially afterwards and address the emotional needs exactly right. 
It’s assumed that mutual understanding is a long, slow process. It is most of the process of conversation.

What do we do when we think we understand the other and believe they’re just wrong? What if both people think that?
The person who believes they understand has the burden of proof. They need to convince the other that they understand. This right to request convincing can be waived.
The NT experience: When people disagree, people don’t always expect to share a foundation with their counterpart that leads to mutual understanding. They see conversation as primarily a conduit for expressing and receiving emotion. 
They’re better at engaging each other emotionally when they’re roughly aligned. But a lot of disagreements end poorly because the misalignments interrupt the flow of expressing/receiving emotions.
NTs don’t usually need to consciously construct coherent models of the world because their emotions serve as an approximately coherent model.
“Moral truth seeking vs self-interested purity”: No responsibility to always look for the truth generally, because there’s so much of it, and also truth is instrumental so you should do what’s interesting to you. High interest to purify what you do model.
Always interested in improving our understanding of things we already care about. No moral responsibility to purify what you model; it’s just assumed to be of interest.
