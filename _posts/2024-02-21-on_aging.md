I have a relatively calm personality, to the point that I'm apathetic to a lot of things, and can't use tropes like 'strangers are wrong on the internet' as motivation to do things. Except it seems that my experience in the longevity field has imbued this ability in this particular field so I'd like to take this unusual opportunity and indulge it. 

...

The instigator of this specific one was on this tweet, but I don't mean to pick on him specifically, it just helps to have something concrete to nitpick. 

>“When we figure out how to significantly slow down aging I am 99% sure that mass production will require technology no more advanced than we had in the 1930s. In other words, we have endured a century of unnecessary suffering because we have not asked sufficiently correct questions about aging, or acted with sufficient urgency.”

1. I don’t disagree that the actual tech may be relatively simple. 
2. I very strongly disagree that it was ‘simply’ a matter of asking sufficiently correct questions  – the soft tissue of understanding ‘how’ to use a technology is a type of advancement in itself that I feel like he is underestimating/downplaying; knowledge of the arrangement and orchestration, not merely the materials themselves, i.e. gold in chip technology, ascorbic acid. 
3. Or ‘simply’ a matter of acting with sufficient urgency - I think he’s underestimating the pervasively human fear of mortality for some reason. Are we in our own local bubbles? Given that the fountain of youth is an old trope, I feel like I'm in the right here.
4. I agree with having not asked sufficiently correct questions, but I don't think it caused unnecessary suffering, in the implication that it was avoidable. 

Let's go further and down the rabbit hole to the article he links to. For example, who is this writer? Someone who claims: 
>“We think of aging as the product of this orphic thing called “time”, ignoring that species far less resourceful than ours live on for centuries longer, and some (like the American lobster) do not decrease in strength, do not have their metabolism slowed down, and become more rather than less fertile, with the passage of time.” 

Is this saying that this is largely a matter of resourcefulness? How embarrassing.

...

If you didn't catch my sarcasm in that last line -- I'm very much joking; I strongly disagree with that premise. In a similar way that 'cancer' conflates very different phenomena, 'aging' conflates many ways of breaking. 

I am not convinced that this level of resolution is the most useful way to solve problems. I am pleased by the interest in that it should better highlight that biology is a complex system that can fail in this gradual way




What an argument: “With the longevity field booming into a multi-trillion-dollar industry, backed by names like Jeff Bezos and corporations like Alphabet, and several companies going into human trials, aging reversal is no longer a matter of if, but when.” So as long as you can throw money and status at it, it should work out, right? 

Guess what pharmaceutical research involves? Throwing a lot of money at things [insert chart]. And how well has that worked?

Okay now I feel like I'm strawmanning by picking on this writer. Let's try to be more productive. 

# possible points of divergence

A cultural difference I've noticed is the belief in the unreasonable effectiveness of predicitve/statistical/probabilitstic models. Concretely, this is the GWAS supporters, 

GWAS. (this also bleeds over into LLMs)
At least one thing I took away from grad school is that there's a difference between predictive models and mechanistic/causal models -- and you cannot assume that predictve models are causally related. 


conflation
intuitions/metaphors of complex systems properties
- breaking of individual vs coordination
- 
predictive models and mechanistic models





simple interventions for complex problems
i.e. corticosteroids for overactive inflammatory conditions. 
eyelid eczema and newer non steroidal ointment; eventually reverted back to steroids. 


card games, gwas

alphafold, ph, lack of interpretable models

confirmation bias; posthoc rationalization, but everything is posthoc rationalization, technically. I'd guess the difference is 

...

So I keep complaining, how miserly -- do I have anything constructive to say?

I think part of my irritation is a a defensive reaction -- most people say it is this way, but this is misleading (the pervasiveness and confidence of the masses led me down the wrong path for a long time and I am somewhat annoyed at that, though it is a good learning experience), stop it propagating it. 

i am lazy, and want to not be so careful/critical in taking in information, but the signal to noise ratio makes it necessary

a thousand brains; the shape of the problem

I didn't mean to go all the way down to the philosophy of biology/theoretical, but that's where I ended up. It's hard to say how much is influenced by having a hammmer (interest in complex systems) and wanting to see nails.

keep in mind my taste 


incomplete nature, failure modes (of )

of the emergent phenomena

more concretely, what does that look like?

maybe I'm overly fixated on a certain means to an end; by valuing mechanistic understanding, but I acknowledge that you can have things working without understanding i.e. I am very grateful for corticosteroids. 




1. One of last few times I was memorably angry was at a centipede that scared me ('how dare you scare me like that, you deserve to die'); a few moments later I had enough self-awareness to reflect ('well that's not very nice, is it').
