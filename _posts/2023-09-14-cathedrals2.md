_or, 'how to find god if your mind works close enough to my own'_


A friend once introduced me as someone who 'is unusually poor at modeling other people but understands herself unusually well'. And so I really don't know how well this generalizes to others, but over the years, people have experimentally confirmed enough of my various misgivings about mainstream strategies that I've developed some confidence that  I'll venture to say that my inclinations are better than others. And this one is pretty decidedly one of my better ones


And since i was indignant no one told me about this, I will cater/here is a homage to my indignant younger self. 

A current hypothesis is that people have trouble finding god because god is a very quiet by default, and peer/external pressure is very loud. In this regard, I had an advantage of being somewhat deaf to external expectations; my own observation felt more real and reliable than 'common sense'. 

The courage to follow your own intuition, even if it'll lead to failure.

Finding god is like doing research.



hobbies/art/writing
being studious/smart
what is worth striving for in life?

In middle school, i was anxious about trying to avoid a midlife crisis. 
And now as I approach 30, I see people with frameworks that look almost certainly subpar, and I am confused people have not similarly taken steps to avoid a trajectory of pain, and so in case a counterfactual version myself also found themslves on this path, here is a potential instructions to get out. 

You are not particularly smart, and people like playing status games. ignore them

People don't usually disagree on values being good, but they vary on the stack ranking. Your priorities are weird, and so some norms will not apply.
You'll be told that most people don't care about truth, and while that's a rather odd framework, it does explain a lot of things.

Try to understand what you fundamentally care about. 
What do you want out of life? When you're on deathbed, what would be life you'd be happy to reflect upon? What is the story you want to live? [see narratives]

no one (I don't) cares how intelligent you are. the real question is, are you satisfying your own aesthetic/god?



I closed the last post with a light directive^1^ to use your aesthetic/god, but it's a rather vague directive. So if you happened to be thinking 'how do you do that weird writer?', that is an excellent question dear reader. I myself discovered it accidentally, and felt something akin to indignant that no one told me about this really cool thing. 

Or maybe they did and I didn't know how to internalize it. I am somewhat suspicious that it's not a coincidence that I have trouble integrating 'common sense'



I think it is easy to go through the motions and miss the entire point. This is exactly what happened with organized religion and english class for me. But maybe we'll be lucky and end up somewhere interesting. But I'll posit that it is easy in general; the story of scurvy is an intriguing parallel.


Either way, when I've found myself with extraordinary luck in stumbling across very nice things (see: [friends]), I feel compelled to try drafting a map to it, in case I ever find myself in a counterfactual reality where I do not have these very nice things. 


Here I attempt to compile a useful guide for you post-hoc, which means it may not working going forward.

There seems to be consensus between those close to me that I lack a certain degree of common sense; things that are obvious to others are not obvious to me. In other words, I often come across as an idiot.  

While I'll graciously accept your sympathies, there is a silver lining: some things are obvious to me that don't seem obvious to others -- like how to avoid being unnecessarily stressed about trying to seem smart. Because I run around in circles where people are smart, I guess it's hard to avoid intelligence as a metric of social status. So if you aren't gifted or well-read/sufficiently competent, one option is to fake it, and bs the signals. 

I barely needed to contemplate whether or not to go down this path because I'm so bungling at BSing that it just wasn't a real option for me.

This recent thread of thought was triggered by the reminder that 'dick-measuring contests', or more generally, that people apparently size each other up to decorate their mental social hierarchy tree, leading to unnecessary heartache/suffering. 

In my circles, these contests are typically around displays of intelligence, generally reflected those who are innately gifted, the studious/self-disciplined/well-read, or both. So a significnt chunk fall into none of these categories are chronically anxious they are not smart enough, and of these, some are . As someone who comfortably navigates interacting with smart people (this is what would be rather embarassing if it turns out I'm actually self-delusional), I would like to politely shake them and patronizingly ask, '_did you know_ there is another way?' (Jesus died for your sins).

You can build a cathedral. 

A cathedral, as in a kludgey assemblage of abstractions, frameworks and heuristics to navigate the world, containing after-thought extensions, winding pathways, and unexpected backdoors. 

An adjacent but colorless/faded/sterile/lifeless term for what I'm trying to gesture to is 'knowledge graph'. A knowledge graph is what your stereotypical medical student might build in their heads, functional but devoid of beauty; Brutalist architecture. 

No, what I'm gesturing to has a greater essence of personal aesthetic, of what one finds beautiful and/or compelling: A cathedral, as in an awe-inspiring structure, built of from a marriage of spiritual ideals and inspired engineering, a concrete implementation of abstract ideals, of fractalish details, a curation of art and design. 

(But neither is it mere art, emotional currents, vibes, psychedelics or whatever, I don't understand those frameworks (yet).)

The key point is that it is _yours_ and you are its chief architect. 

That means, whatever you don't like, you may destroy, and whatever you want for it, you may attempt to build. 


II. Cathedrals in society

'Are you sure you know what you're talking about'/'I've never heard of this before'.

Neither have I, until I already had one. 

But once you know what it looks like, you realize it's hidden in plain sight. There are numerous oblique cultural references to it, but it's like a cliche; you think you understand it until you have a specific kind of experience/insight and then you _really_ understand it.

For example, I think it also overlaps with being independent-minded, but most descriptions of it are somewhat dry and vague, in a 'knowledge graph' kind of way; there is not much emphasis on taste. Or it is alluded to superficially, on its outcome rather than the underlying mechanism that drives it. Conspiracy theorists and schizophrenics are also independent minded, but in a socially disapproved way. 

It is something like hard-coding vs soft-coding. Hard coding generally takes external cues, but soft-coding means multiple ways to implement, which means choice, which means aesthetic to tiebreak. 


Be curious, they say. Be independent minded, they say. 



III. a practical guide to building cathedrals

Just kidding. That's rather unhelpfully vague.

But I do think it's hard to give concrete advice a void of people whose minds could work radically (I once had a fun talk with a friend's friend about how our mental worlds are organized, and at the end of the conversation, she asked, 'So, what drugs do you use?'). Organized religions have done an okay job so far, so let's start there:

A practical guide to god/how to find god

it is a quiet voice, and it takes time and effort to notice it. 

one of the commandments: do not let pride ruin things

instead of god, what would go at the top? how to deal with hard decisions?
the north star, the ultimate tiebreaker: to understand

1. be looking/open
2. pray; introspection i.e. meditating, writing
3. go to church/read the bible - i literally went to church
4. surrendering; coherency/consistency, peace of mind, better at managing uncertainty
5. keep up your relationship with god; habitual/housekeeping

origin of consciousness
the artist's way

The Artist's Way is a good place that espouses such ideas, except the things you are assessing as beautiful are algorithms and frameworks. 

a useful framing is that you cannot control your reaction to things, so do not judge yourself there. But you can control the thought after. and it is there that you can enact change
placing a trigger to change future thought paths, and over time, changing thought ruts.

1. I am not sure what everyone's God is like, and I am not sure if everyone's God is worth following, so I leave it to your discretion. 

I'm not saying that you need to be an idiot for this to be obvious, but I think it helps.

I don't have great reflexes or a knack for thinking on the fly, so I tend to do a decent amount of pre-planning for situations




1. follow your interests to a certain level of mastery
2. follow another field of interest to a similar levle of mastery
3. think about thinking
3. find isomorphisms between them

even something as 'objective' as scientific models/hypotheses are subejct to 'aesthetic'

self fulfilling prophecies, optimism, meaning, are things you choose and build for yourself.
