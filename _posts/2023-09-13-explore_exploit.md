In college, a friend patiently explained the concept of breadth vs depth-first search, and I thought it was a cute concept.

A number of years later, in _The Origins of Order_, I learned of the explore vs exploit paradigm, and somehow, even though they feel largely isomorphic, that has superceded breadth- vs depth-first search in terms of mental references/utility. 

Perhaps it situated it better in terms of tradeoffs: 

I notice that I'm generally biased towards exploration over exploitation -- I need to intentionally build in deadlines/incentives to get myself to finish things. 

I don't think one is inherently better than the other; as with most things, it depends on context. 

This topic became more salient recently because I was in discussions of 

Startups and engineering vs research

Why 


In the exploration paradigm, you want to optimize for low stakes, to remove external pressures and considerations so that you can better focus on the internal sensor for 'what is interesting/sparkly' -- I find that it is a relatively quiet signal. You want things to be low stakes so that you don't judge an idea's value prematurely, giving space for unknown unknowns. 

In the exploitation paradigm, I think, works best when there is relatively minimal unknown unknowns relevant to completing the project.
