Transplant immunology is a great place to sightsee the paradoxical 'robust but fragile' character of biological systems -- you really can just switch out an organ for another in a mostly modular way, but it also needs to be just so. The ideal is a full genetic match (i.e. an identical twin), but  most are 'close enough', optimized for need and risk of rejection. generally fail after some number of years. And you really don't want them to fail. Arguably a hook is a decent replacement for a lost hand, but we're not that competitive for engineered internal organs yet. 

We therefore have an impressive logistics infrastructure for orchestrating organ transplants. I am simple-minded and like seeing massive structures like bridges and skyscrapers up close, and this is the biggest, most functional human coordination efforts I've seen up close. 

The logistics of transplant is impressive, but the expense of it makes me wish for the replacement organ/immune matching problem to be solved, at the cost of future generations not being able to enjoy the drama of flying out to get an organ.

Research with immunotyping has mostly resolved acute rejection issues, especially with kidney transplants, but chronic rejection is still the cause of graft failure after 10 years.

I've mostly accepted this fact for about 10 years as well, but I recently encountered someone with an almost 30 year graft from his father, whose graft is also slowly getting worse (as measured by the glomeular filtration rate). My impression is that they say that this slow decline in function is caused by nephropathy, that is caused by chronic rejection. but i somehow find it weird that the immune system would attack the organ so slowly, so patiently. I'm not aware of mechanisms of the innate or adaptive immune system that respond on this timescale

then they postulate that calceneurin inhibitors cause ER stress and increase apoptosis, but why is this an allograft specific thing? or is it kidney specific? (do other organ transplant recipients treated with cyclosporin also have this increased risk?) cyclisporin vs tacrolimus era
.
liver transplant as weird, maybe because it is immunologically weird, and escalation of immunosuppression does not reliably work in cases of chronic rejection. 

Infectious Causation of Disease: An Evolutionary Perspective is a memorable article for pointing out the process of figuring the cause of disease isn't clean at all, and that there have been mixups in the past, and suggests that atherosclerosis may have an infectious factor. chronic infection -> chronic wound

i wonder if chronic rejection, which is often a variant of vasculopathy, might also be a type of chronic wound

university senior design project; there are multiple causes/aetiologies of chronic wounds. i.e. diabetic, ulcer/venous
currently, acute versus chronic inflammation

and then in aging, there was inflammaging, described as a low level chtonic inflammation

I weirdly have a hard time learning biology textbook style, and through this lens, I've finally gotten a better understanding of immunology.

immunosuppresents make them faceblind? or unable to act on their biases?
