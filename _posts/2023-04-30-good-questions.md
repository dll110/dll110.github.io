chatgpt, google, people: prompt engineering
not necessarily transferable; 

three cases of asking questions:
an unknown field
how to get content/mass to shape things, what objects are there?
feeling sthe shape of something in a nonnovel field
figuring out potential associations/implications/integrations
when you’ve already felt out a good amount of the shape of something; is it a suitable shape to fit here?

i ask a lot of questions, few answers, seems like it was the better bet. but now, with things like chatgpt, when will it become automated?
how would you automate it? 
give it motivation/ideals/target

intuition:
starts with a framework – it’s hard to ask good questions in a void/knowing little about a topic/being uninterested
but then you can turn to orienting questions
with no expectations, no surprise, no questions
questions to resolve the surprise

easy to ask questions when something is hooky; lights up a lot of paths in your brain
questions to help clarify the shape of the problem
a flow state of questions: not too specific, not too general, able to help piece together/deduce shape

‘what happens with’



asking good questions 1:1 versus in a group setting

plato/greek theory/why socratic method works, the paradox of inquiry:
questions came from knowledge that your soul had but forgot and is trying to remember
