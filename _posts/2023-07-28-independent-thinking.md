working title: how to not be a conspiracy theorist
working goal: how to do independent thinking well/how to think independently, successfully 
date started: 2023/07/28



once upon a time, say in summer 2020, I had a mild crisis of self-doubt.

summer 2020, in case you haven’t made the connection, was the first summer of the pandemic, and the summer I came to terms with the unreliability of established media outlets. I think the final blow was watching CNN coverage of the capital storming, and the news anchor going, ‘this is not the america we know’ in a ‘I’m surprised by your bad behavior – you should know better and I’m very disappointed in you’ kind of tone. My mental reaction to that was, isn’t that your job? to keep a finger on things that are happening throughout america and be able to provide useful commentary on why we’re seeing what we’re seeing. this is a failing as a newsperson if this is not the america you know, because that means your models are wrong and you should correct them – what are you going to do about it??’ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/January_6_United_States_Capitol_attack 2021

concurrently, I had been struggling to integrate with the biology of aging field for the past two years, and not being able to make it sit comfortable – I can consciously follow why people think this is cool, but I do not emotionally relate. I felt like an outsider in the field of aging because I am very okay with the idea of my own mortality. many in the aging field are satisfied with answers that I feel is not sufficiently satisfactory, and yet I am unable to make headway in a direction that I feel is more interesting. 

paul graham’s independent thinking essay came out Nov 2022. It was an interesting topic but it was not very helpful. it was validating in that i feel i am taking an independent thinking approach already. but what he never gestures to is how hard it can be, and that there is the real pitfall of doing worse than being a sheep, which would at least get you to average. 

i had been listening to the portal podcast around that time (perhaps specifically 40: Introducing The Portal Essay Club - What if everyone is simply insane? on Apple Podcasts) and it occurred to me that you could be the insane one. Insane just means a distance from your norm, and it is relative, possibly mutually perceived. I also met a conspiracy theorist that summer. He sounded pretty reasonable, with some takes that question the norm. until he started commenting on the areas I was well-versed in, and i realized that his takes were worse than default/the doctrine. You can not follow the herd, and be worse. 

when I was sufficiently overwhelmed, I went to my close friends, broliver, and received reassurance and future insurance/assurance: the solution to this problem is friends. not just any good friend, but friends that are good at critical thinking in a way that you admire [what if you have bad taste in what is good taste?]. friends that will be frank with you and tell you what they think. and that means being a person where such friends will find it worthwhile to tell you what they think. 

In summer 2021, a friend recommended ‘Edison as i knew him’, citing this particular passage:
“That bang on the table was worth worlds to me. No man up to then had given me any encouragement. I had hoped that I was headed right, sometimes I knew that it was, sometimes I only wondered if I was”.
And somehow it was grounding to get an example that it is normal to have doubts, and it is worth seeking those who can encourage you. 

I suspect that independent thinking, ironically, is best done with the help of others. 


when should you do dependent thinking? for the things you encounter once and have no care for.
