This did not work for the nonfiction I read. I’d go through the motions of reading several pages and not absorb anything I read. I slowly unlearned this habit by keeping a piece of computer paper folded up into quarters as a bookmark, and taking notes to make sure I was comprehending and not forget the interesting bits. I’d conveniently have all the things I found noteworthy on a sheet/sheets of paper to review at the end.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It worked well enough, to the point that I started feeling that nonfiction books were superior to fiction because they were more easily embedded – when you finish a fictional novel/series, it is done, complete. But after finishing a nonfiction book, it was not uncommon to find it referenced in another book, or find that its ideas would concretely affect how you thought about things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then, it is a few years after college and I am having fun learning things that I find interesting, in a different country, and getting paid for it. Then I notice a strange coincidence: my young adult life so far looks like a modern-day parallel of a typical fantasy/adventure story – a young person backpacks far and wide, sometimes with friends along the way (in this very modern story, I can take my close friends with me because we hang out virtually), and finds the wizard to apprentice themself to, learns magic, traveling far, traveling light. And when things seem uncertain and intimidating, I think of how challenges are essential in making a story interesting. “Things will be okay in the end. If it’s not okay, it’s not the end.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stepping back, it is rather tickling to realize there is the potential framing of this as an underdog story, where the humble, frivolous story has a higher level impact on the seemingly more virtuous/practical fact-based/objective nonfiction books. It dictates the story, the overall arc, of your life. I suppose a similar effect may be achieved with biographies. But for some reason I’ve only started reading them more recently. (Also real life role models, but I didn’t have any). But I think the critical bit is that it’s hard to grow in a cohesive direction unless you aspire to a platonic ideal of yourself – but you first need to develop a platonic ideal of yourself (I took this phrase from a twitter post).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wonder if that’s related to the problem that’s pervasive among the kids today. I’d think that ordinarily, it’s only critical to do an exploration of narratives/lifestyles if you’re going to deviate from the norm. But now, the default paths have dried up, and many have not explored a wide enough range of narratives to cultivate a deep taste in who they want to be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And I wonder if this relates to depressive nihilism, where my speculated preventative against depressive nihilism is being aware of the things that matter to you. Because even if you think objectively that nothing matters in the end, you feel that things matter to you. And I suspect that’s real enough to live a life out on.&lt;/p&gt;

It’s been interesting to try to analyze our unspoken norms, our deep assumptions on how you’re supposed to interact with others, which has evidently yet unconsciously facilitated our friendship. Here are some characteristics we’ve identified, derived from informative cultural clashes with guests. It is derived from a collaborative draft, but I’m taking this as an exercise in editing it in the way I’d better understand it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The identified norms:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;separation of personal and factual&lt;/strong&gt;
Taste and logic are extremely distinct, and they both always matter. It’s assumed that all logic is motivated by emotion. There are no objective value judgments. Conversely, there’s always a logic to emotion. Everything outside of the driving emotional core can be challenged, including beliefs about the emotional core. But the fact that there is a core is a given, and it can never be wrong, because feelings are just feelings. We try very hard to distinguish statements of facts and statements of feeling.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;separation of personal and societal&lt;/strong&gt;
We see society’s aesthetic as pretty arbitrary, so we don’t evaluate people’s worth in a broader societal-values sense and tend to come off as nonjudgmental. But we judge things as far as they relate to our interests/tastes; we find people uninteresting or aesthetically displeasing. Apparently, the norm is to put a lot of weight into your own and others’ societal worth.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;moral truth seeking vs self-interested purity&lt;/strong&gt;
There is no responsibility to always look for more truth, because there’s so much of it, and also truth is instrumental so you should do what’s interesting to you. In other words, you are permitted to not care about lots of things and put model-flaws on the backburner, as long it is acknowledged as such. The expectation is in trying to purify/make consistent what you &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; model and care about. This is distinct from the rationalist norm, where there is moral responsibility to seek the truth immediately; here, truth-seeking is merely because you care.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;good faith&lt;/strong&gt;
Everybody has coherent models and is trying to communicate clearly about them, so even if you disagree, assume that they have something else coherent in view. It’s assumed that mutual understanding is a long, slow process. The conversation is largely about clarifying all the facts so that a convergent understanding arises relatively trivially. At the object level, everything can be questioned, including somebody’s logic and standing. This is sustainable because at the meta level, we always trust each other to be able to align, and that’s why we’re here; it’s never in question as long as we’re present.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;intention orientation&lt;/strong&gt;
It is hard to control emotion, so we tend to read intention much more heavily. This means that harsh tones are often taken impersonally and ignored, unless someone explicitly wants to put it on the table as a factor to consider. This allows the discussion to default towards attempting to build a coherent explanatory model, unless they explicitly want to switch modes towards having emotions assauged. The more prevalent norm seems to expect people to express their emotion right, so that interpreted emotion is assumed to be reality.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;commitment&lt;/strong&gt;
We think it’s important to strive for global coherency in yourself and present yourself to other people with as much consistency as possible. You are expected to be the best judge of your values and have the best vantage point for considering the full trajectory of a decision (see 4. good faith). Therefore we are very accepting of others’ autonomy in decision-making, even if not well-understood. However, the decision maker is always responsible for the outcome. No resentment allowed. It seems more normal to share responsibility in decision-making i.e. resent someone for their influence on your decision.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Are there deeper trends behind these observations?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wonder if these norms arise and converge due to the experience of having a more distant starting point relative to other people, so we are used to assuming a more naive and tolerant stance, combined with a desire to build and improve aesthetic internal frameworks with others. This prioritizes norms that make communication clearer and lower-stakes, especially of otherwise sensitive/taboo internal data and perceptions. In other words, this optimization gives us sufficient degrees of freedom to resolve seeming paradoxes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is rather tentative modeling; I am curious how the relatability (or not) to this description corresponds to real life experiences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve been reading David Lipsky’s “Although of course you end up becoming yourself: A road trip with David Foster Wallace”. It’s not something I would ordinarily pick up, but I’ve been primed because a number of people in my social circles have been talking about David Foster Wallace lately (n=2…but they don’t know each other!)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I came to learn of this book’s existence from a twitter thread that I can no longer find. It quoted this bit by DFW: “…I think that the ultimate way you and I get lucky is if you have some success early in life, you get to find out early it doesn’t mean anything. Which means you get to start early the work of figuring out what does mean something.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m very much not a paragon of success, but my mind still goes ‘I know what he’s talking about’. And the interpretation is something like, ‘it doesn’t mean much if others are impressed if you aren’t; it doesn’t matter if others think it means something if you don’t’.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think it’s related to undeserved success: I found that it’s one thing to know about it, and it’s another thing to experience it close up. If you’re reminded of imposter syndrome, I agree—it’s like an inverse of imposter syndrome: Though it’s not me whose level of competence is in question (conveniently, I’m too inept to fake anything), but society’s—specifically, their ability to evaluate. It’s led to generalized apathy towards external success markers—they’re proxy measures that I now regard with more suspicion/wariness. It’s a rather unnerving development because it comes with a sense of alienation and detachment from mainstream social narrative-reality of what matters—it seems like a step towards delusion (maybe let me expound on the relatability of a cancer cell in a later post).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that’s an unspoken peril of figuring out what &lt;em&gt;does&lt;/em&gt; mean something.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Paul Graham wrote &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.paulgraham.com/think.html&quot;&gt;a nice essay about independent thinking&lt;/a&gt;, but it was about successful independent thought, and I’ve been worrying about unsuccessful independent thought. I’m afraid of becoming a conspiracy theorist. Or delusional — I’ve more recently finished “Logicomix: An Epic Search for Truth”, and they don’t shy away from the association of schizophrenia/delusional thinking and people who are striving to figure things out. I’m definitely not as passionate and meticulous as these logicians, but it is relatable enough to unsettle me. I don’t think you don’t need to be a genius to find ‘A Beautiful Mind’ horrifying. And on my backlog of books to read is “Lost in Math: How Beauty Leads Physics Astray”, because I’ve been saliently using aesthetic/intuition/beauty as a means to choose my mental structures (see: future post on mental interior design).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, what to do about this?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think a preventative practice to this is getting regular feedback. I’ve been extremely fortunate to have friends that help me build and refine mental frameworks. But I’m aware that we’re a specific type of people and few—I’m missing a broader perspective. And so, an obvious solution seems to be to write.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are a myriad of reasons of why I’m not much of a writer, one reason being that I’m shy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Though, not DFW-shy: “I think being shy basically means being self-absorbed to the extent that it makes it difficult to be around other people. For instance, if I’m hanging out with you, I can’t even tell whether I like you or not, because I’m too worried about whether you like me. It’s stressful and unpleasant or whatever.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wondered if I was misunderstanding him, but he followed up with,  “Part of the shyness for me is, it’s very easy for me to play this game of, What do you want? What will the effect of this be on you? You know? It’s this kind of mental chess. Which in personal intercourse? Makes things very difficult. But in writing, when I think a lot of what you’re doing—there are very few innocent sentences in writing. You’ve gotta know not just how it looks and sounds to you. But you’ve gotta be able plausibly to project what an alien consciousness will make of it” (24). I definitely don’t do that on a regular basis, so I’m not DFW-shy. In fact my shyness is due to my inability to model others – it’s less worrying about whether they like me, and moreso having minimal perceived feedback, so it’s like writing into a void and not being sure if I’m even understandable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another excuse is that writing is hard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even texting is hard—I’m baffled and in awe of people who can text throughout the day on a daily basis. Not that long ago, I learned that some people primarily think in language, so to communicate, it’s pretty straightforward to transcribe their thoughts into speech. I seem to think more in ‘pre-language’; communication is more like trying to describe a scenery or cloud of concepts. I often get tripped up in knowing where to start, and in linearizing ideas that don’t have a linear structure. I’m not sure if it’s a legitimate excuse, but I wonder if this contributes to ease-of-communication baselines. The hope is that I’ll develop better transcription heuristics as I write more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I suppose I’m starting to write now because while these frictions haven’t decreased, the incentives have increased.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As DFW also astutely notes, “somebody who’s writing, has part of their motivation to sort of I think impress themselves and their consciousness on others. There’s an unbelievable arrogance about even trying to write something…” And, well, I &lt;em&gt;am&lt;/em&gt; trying to asserting/indulging my sense of aesthetic here. Arrogantly, maybe tautologically, &lt;a href=&quot;https://dll110.github.io/eat/&quot;&gt;I do like my aesthetic&lt;/a&gt;. But part of my taste is in the integrity of the ideas, and I’ve been feeling the limitations of my current approach for a while now. The ideas in my head don’t feel sufficiently processed and &lt;a href=&quot;https://dll110.github.io/poop/forgetfully.html&quot;&gt;compressed&lt;/a&gt;, and all advice seems to point to writing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While I anticipate these writing exercises to mainly benefit myself, there’s some small hope that it could be a source of solidarity. I’ve recently finished a book called “Discovering: Inventing and Solving Problems at the Frontiers of Scientific Knowledge” (Root-Bernstein), and on the last page, it said, “If what we’ve said and done here gives such a person the courage to do science on his own and in his own way–you know I mean her, too–then we have succeeded in producing something important” (428). Unlike other independently-thinking people I know, I’m often much more uncertain and unconfident.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another reason I picked up the book “Although of course you end up becoming yourself” was because I like the title. It reads like a reassurance—&lt;em&gt;you’ll find your way, eventually&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;comments solicited, &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.google.com/document/d/1qpSEuLDHJtHC38dWwjdwWorMSu0OhHnOf1xdrBf7T3Q/edit?usp=sharing&quot;&gt;kludgey comment-able form here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">[written 2021/03/23]</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">how to ask good questions?</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/poop/good_questions" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="how to ask good questions?" /><published>2023-04-30T00:00:00-07:00</published><updated>2023-04-30T00:00:00-07:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/poop/good-questions</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/poop/good_questions">&lt;p&gt;A friend recently introduced me to “the paradox of inquiry”, specifically the idea that &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anamnesis_(philosophy)&quot;&gt;‘questions came from knowledge that your soul had but forgot and is trying to remember’&lt;/a&gt;. So maybe I have a lot of questions because I’ve &lt;a href=&quot;dll110.github.io/poop/forgetfully&quot;&gt;forgotten&lt;/a&gt; so much.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Somehow it’s hard to notice if you ask more questions than average, but it’s been mentioned often enough over the years that I’m presuming there’s a trend somewhere. Curiously, it does not really help me write good prompts to chatgpt, given the lackluster answers it gives me. I am decent at googling though, so it’s probably learnt (I’m not really sure why I’m not compelled to learn LLM prompting though).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is easy to ask questions when something is interesting because it lights up a lot of potential paths in your brain. This seems to be what Plato/Socrates observed, where it’s easier to ask questions when you already know about a topic. I think it’s because these tend to be questions to help &lt;em&gt;refine&lt;/em&gt; the shape of an area, and the degree of resolution is such that your questions can be relatively pointed and specific. Questions that people consider ‘good’ seem to more of this type.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s harder to ask questions in a void, because without some basic knowledge, there’s no expectations. And with no expectations, there’s no surprise; with no surprise, there’s no questions, at least of a clarifying type. But then you can turn to orienting questions, questions for obtaining a mass of content that you can later shape and refine. I find myself feeling more clunky in this realm, but I wonder if it’s somewhat the nature of these types of questions: they naturally have less hooks, and so come less reflexively and tend to be rather generic. Perhaps they get the perception of being dumb questions because they don’t show off any existing understanding. I think they’re especially important though and I need to intentionally work to improve upon these for myself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve adopted the notion that a bad question is better than no question. This is mostly a tool for overcoming self-consciousness, which is not really important, especially relative to the opportunity to understand something better (in general, I have not yet identified an area where it is better to give heavy consideration towards your pride). And if it is an effort towards that, it is a worthy question, even if it is to help you understand how to ask better questions (though I should probably caveat that I haven’t historically been pestered by questions, partially because I prefer to be on the question-asking side of things).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are at least three artificial categories for asking questions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;exploring an unknown/new field – how to get content/mass to shape things; what objects are there? getting the other to be more verbose is generally better here. ‘why’, ‘tell me more’ are examples here.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;feeling out the shape of an area/concept; figuring out what it is and what it is not; trying on various metaphors/parallels to see how well they fit&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;a miscellaneous category, because it’s artificial&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I do notice that I seem to have a lot of question relative to answers, so here are some representative standing questions:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What would it take to automate question-asking? How would you automate it? Some complex method would be to give it motivation/ideals/target, mostly because I find it much harder to ask questions when I am not interested. What drives the feeling of being interested?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why is asking good questions generally easier in a 1:1 setting versus in a group setting? Versus asking a chatbot? Maybe something about the correlation with a tighter feedback loop?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Take it from someone who’s been scooped, of sorts:
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Around 2019, I went to a talk by Marinka Zitnik and learned about the Stanford SNAP page, where I learned about the TreeOfLife dataset. Later I read Erik Hoel’s emergence paper around the same time, and realized I could apply his measure to the TreeOfLife dataset. Evidence: https://github.com/dll110/treeoflife I never finished it though because it was just a side-hobby (my actual research work had nothing to do with either of these topics directly) and I got distracted by other things.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Then last year I came across &lt;a href=&quot;https://academic.oup.com/ib/article/13/12/283/6474503&quot;&gt;“Evolution and emergence: higher order information structure in protein interactomes across the tree of life”&lt;/a&gt; when looking through Michael Levin’s publications:  Pretty much EI-Net + TreeOfLife data. Published by the original EI peeps and Michael Levin – I’d bet they have sound thinking. 
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Which means I have proof that I have great ideas. A full two years before they published. My intuitions are validated without me having to write up a full paper. And I wouldn’t have gotten such validation if I had actually written it. 
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Of course, it would’ve been an actually cool paper to have under my belt, but that’s more of a resume thing than a personal thing. 
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
In “Letters to a Young Scientist”, E.O. Wilson wrote ‘look for a field that is sparsely inhabited; look for a chance to break away, to find a subject you can make your own…shy away from subjects that are receiving a great deal of attention, if it has a glamorous aura, if its practitioners are prizewinners who receive large grants…take a subject instead that interests you and looks promising, where established experts are not yet competing with each other’. (45)
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The takeaway is, if your poop is getting scooped, find pastures elsewhere. Your poop is better served fertilizing a new field.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">I attended a number of seminars this week, and a number of them self-consciously joked about being scooped. This is not really frequency illusion – I’m pretty sure it’s a cultural norm/meme. I’ve never really understood it though. Wouldn’t it just be validation/consilience that you’re on the right track? And that means you can get your curiosities solved without doing the work! You can turn your attention to the other things you’re interested in. Take it from someone who’s been scooped, of sorts: Around 2019, I went to a talk by Marinka Zitnik and learned about the Stanford SNAP page, where I learned about the TreeOfLife dataset.

&lt;p&gt;Armand Marie Leroi describes a specimen in the Vrolik museum labelled as ‘acardia amorphus’, “a skin-covered sphere with nothing to hint at the child it almost became except for a small umbilical cord, a bit of intestine, and the rudiments of a vertebral column.”
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
It was a startling thing to read because until then, I did not know that human development could go so awry – that &lt;i&gt;I&lt;/i&gt; could’ve gone so awry. To think, that I could’ve been a ball. 
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I felt the compulsion to see concrete evidence of this – surely Armand was exaggerating? But this was back in 2008ish, when googling such a thing gave me unsatisfying, less sphereical variants (actually, it still does). But I was lucky and resourceful: I found someone’s flickr album of their visit to the Vrolik Museum, and flipping through their comprehensive-enough pictures of the display cases, I spotted it. It was rather unassuming, but he was not exaggering. Its roundness was unmistakeable. I’ve saved it – now posted here to satisfy your curiosity (it is on the right, bottom-middle). 
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Six years later, I still somehow found it compelling enough that, when on a trip to Paris, I took a detour to Amsterdam for less than 24 hours, just to see it in person.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
And more than a decade later, I came across 
&lt;a href=&quot;../documents/Douglas Hofstadter - Metamagical Themas_Ch 23 On the Seeming Paradox of Mechanizing Creativity.pdf&quot;&gt;The Seeming Paradox of Mechanizing Creativity”, in Metamagical Themas (Hofstadter)&lt;/a&gt;
where he talks about ‘sphexishness’, or a rough gauge of complexity by how good at ‘rut-breaking’ it is. It gave me another way to help express my fascination with acardia amorphus – I could’ve been so &lt;i&gt;sphexish&lt;/i&gt;.
