title: stuff I like

For better or worse, I suspect I might be rather oblivious to style/tone, 
because I've heard complaints about that for some of these books, 
but I'd vouch for content as these are things that've had a large impact on how I currently think about things. 
<br />
<br />
I'm of the belief that appreciating something can be learned: 
Things I find interesting now have been things I've previously considered dull, and 
things I've considered dull have shifted interesting in the perspective of another.
Along these lines, I've also thought it'd be nice to read a book that's been annotated by someone else, 
so feel free to send one my way :] 
<br />
<br />
Unfortuantely, most of the books I've read were borrowed from a library, so I don't have any annotated books myself. 
But for now, I plan to include some commentary about them here to highlight what I found valuable about it.<br />
<br />
<br />
Annecdotally, there seems to be a trend people I know having a strong or weak general sense of identity. 
That is, someone feels like that strongly identify as a man/woman seem likely to also strongly identify with other labels.
I don't care at all if people misgender me or address me by a different name.
I'm not sure how cohesive it seems from the outside, but I feel like the books I like are a good approximation of me.
